This week, we are going to study a $M/M/1/K$ queue to illustrate the effects of a finite buffer length. We will compute the loss probability in this model and observe the influence of the load $\\rho$ when the capacity $K$ is large. \n",

    "**1)** Complete the code of the function **MM1K** below. This function generates one trajectory of a $M/M/1/K$ queue. The function returns the instants of events (arrivals or departures), the number of customers in the system at these instants, as well as the number of arrivals and of lost customers. Customers are lost if the buffer is full when they arrive. Default parameters will be set as follows: MMM1K($K=3$, $\\lambda = 4$, $\\mu = 5$, $N0 = 2$, $Tmax=100$). $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the arrival and departure rates, $K$ is the maximum number of customers in the system, $N0$ is the initial number of customers, and the evolution of the number of customers in the system is simulated over $[0,Tmax]$. Plot a trajectory of the number of customers in the system against time, obtained after running function **MM1K** with the default parameters."
